# Terraria Auto Fisher

Hello, this is an automated fishing tool for Terraria using pixel detection.
This program should work on any resolution, as you choose the are to scan.
It has very basic auto-potion management, live preview, and hotkey support.
I made it to crate farm, so this code will be based around that


# Features

- F5 Hotkey: Toggle On/Off
- Area Selection: Customizable area for the program to scan
- Live Mini-Cam: Preview of the selected scan area (only works when auto fishing is on)
- Auto Potion Usage (Consumes every 4 minutes, it is to match crate potions. Change it yourself if you want)
  - Fishing Potion (slot 2)
  - Sonar Potion (slot 3)
  - Crate Potion (slot 4)
  - Chum Bucket (slot 5)
- Potion Timer Display: Countdown showing when it'll drink potions and throw chum again


# How to use

1. Place your Rod at slot 1
2. Place your Fishing Potions at slot 2
3. Place your Sonar Potions at slot 3
4. Place your Crate Potions at slot 4
5. Place your Chum Buckets at slot 5

1. Make sure your slot selected before starting program is slot 1
2. Click "Select Scan Area" - Click and drag the box so that the bottom is ever so slightly at/above water level
3. Pick a good area for your mouse to rest and click
4. Start!


DISCLAIMER:
You may need to tweak the area to scan a couple times to get consistent results

# ANOTHER DISCLAIMER
ALSO, I am not responsible if you get in any trouble using this script, it should be fine but some servers may not allow it.
